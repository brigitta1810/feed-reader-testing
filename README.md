# Feed Reader Testing
It is a project aimed at testing the functionality of the Feed Reader app. The main focus of testing, and our expectation is that: every feed element should have a name and URL, the menu should be hidden by default but becomes visible if the user clicks on the hamburger menu icon, when the feed is loaded - at least one element should show up, and feed content is changing when new feed is loaded. 

# Steps required to successfully run the application. 

Clone this repo to your PC using Git, or simply download the project from GitHub in ZIP format.  Once downloaded, open the .html file in your browser (should work in any browser). It might take some time for the file to load. Check out the test results on the bottom of the page. It usually takes a few seconds for the results to load (at least on my laptop), so wait patiently. 

You should see 4 test suits (written in black), and the group of tests in green fonts under each suit.
